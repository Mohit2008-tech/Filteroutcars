# Overview
This is basically a car filteration web app ,
This will picks your prefrences and give the best 30 cars ( in the descending order of their sales ) 
**instead of working on my data set , you can also upload your own data set to test my filter **
, you can use any data set , but it should be in given format 
https://github.com/Mohit2008-tech/Filteroutcars/blob/main/Demo_Format.csv
means use have to use only these columns but you can add as many rows you want , and can add your own company also like Torato , Pampo , etc , this filter will pick out the unique names and will put it into your dropboxes

like this
i also uploaded the demo file to test my prototype https://github.com/Mohit2008-tech/Filteroutcars/blob/main/Engage_demo.csv

##2.  GitHub repository name or URL    
##       a) select Github and paste there https://github.com/Mohit2008-tech/Filteroutcars
##       b) Git ref (branch, tag, or commit)   ---leave it blank
##       c) URL to open (optional) 
##             select URL option and put there 
##             voila/render/Engage.ipynb

and wait for a couple of minutes to load the files from my github account
you will directly go to my web app 
# Future Scope 
### 1 make it for any no of columns ( not restrict yourself to demo format only )
### 2 Giving it an interactive interface by using Css in python
### 3 connect it with Api 's to show the pic of car , and also make it a car purchasing web app.

# My Opinion and journey to my project
This was very struggling and thriving journey , i learnt a lot by this journey , 
How to work in deadline
How to use stackflow to remove your errors
and you have to do again and again , until you wins , i think my code is simple but in resolving tiny things , like how ML works , how voila works , how binder works ,takes my whole time . 
so that's all i learnt this month
