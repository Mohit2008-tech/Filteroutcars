and wait for a couple of minutes to load the files from my github account
you will directly go to my web app 
# Working 
## 1) Picking unique elements from the columns for dropdown buttons

# Future Scope 
### 1 make it for any no of columns ( not restrict yourself to demo format only )
### 2 Giving it an interactive interface by using Css in python
### 3 connect it with Api 's to show the pic of car , and also make it a car purchasing web app.

### 3 https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/    It helps me to create buttons like , dropdown box , int slider etc in python using ipywidget
### 4 https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/14607954?start=525#overview    As i was a beigner in ML, this course  give me an overview that how ML works 
# journey to my project
This was very struggling and thriving journey , i learnt a lot by this journey , 
How to work in deadline,
How to use stackflow to remove your errors
and the most important thing  you have to try again and again , until you wins , i think my code is so complex but in resolving tiny things , like how ML works , how voila works , how binder works ,takes my whole time . 
so that's all i learnt this month
